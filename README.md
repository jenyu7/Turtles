El Cazador 

Description:

   El Cazador is a game that consists of a 9x9 grid (in default mode) and animals randomly spread about the grid. The animals are either predators or prey, and the player uses numbers that are revealed in boxes bordering the animals to achieve the goal. The object of this game is to catch all the prey before getting killed by the predators. 
   The game is a lot like Minesweeper in that patches of unoccupied "squares" on the grid open up, and reveal the numbers that provide the hints at where animals are located. Furthermore, "choosing" a square with a predator (bad!) on it will reduce the life of the player. Likewise, choosing a square with a prey on it will increment the player's catch points by 1.
